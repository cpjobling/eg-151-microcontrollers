# Second lab exercise - indexing and summation

Modify the [PROG5.asm](https://github.com/cpjobling/eg-151-microcontrollers/blob/master/src/lab2/PROG5.asm) to achieve 

1. display the sum of one student's number on LED by pressing SW4; 
2. display the sum of the other student's number on LED by pressing SW3.

## Method

1. Draw a flow chart of the provided programme.
2. Replace the number table with one student number.
3. Add another table for the second student number.

You are then to use two buttons to select between the two student numbers and calculate the sum.

* Draw a new flowchart for the revised programme (hint: reuse the code from Exercise 1)
* Implement the revised programme.
