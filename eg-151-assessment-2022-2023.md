## Introduction

EG-151 Microcontrollers is a 10-credit module running in the first semester. It introduces the structure and operation of a basic 8-bit microcontroller. It is intended to give you a grounding in the use of microcontrollers by taking you from some simple C-language programs to a mini-project that addresses a real engineering task. Assessment is by means of laboratory exercises recording in a lab diary, a class test, and a mini-project.

This document is also available in [PDF form](https://github.com/cpjobling/eg-151-microcontrollers/blob/master/eg-151-assessment-2022-2023.pdf).

## Module Aims

EG-151 aims to introduce you to laboratory work in Electronic and Electrical Engineering, the fundamentals of microcontroller structure and operation and to help you to develop skills in low-level programming language and project work. There will be a lab introduction, an introduction to programming in the embedded C-language, an appreciation of low-level programming with assembly code, and opportunities to apply what you have learned to a simple microcontroller-driven instrumentation project.

## Summary of assessment

Module assessment components: Laboratory Introduction (15%) + Laboratory work (20%) + Class test (35%) + Mini-project (30%)

## Access to the Digital Learning Platform

Access to course resources, on-demand activities, timetabled classes, formative quizzes, discussions and full instructions for the practical exercises for each component are provided in the **[Course Content](https://canvas.swansea.ac.uk/courses/36816/modules) (Modules)** section of the Canvas site for **[2223_EG-151 Microcontrollers](https://canvas.swansea.ac.uk/courses/36816)**. Practice test questions will be made available in the **Assessment and Feedback** section of the Canvas site.

## Module Delivery Method

EG-151 will employ a blended approach to delivery using the Canvas Digital Learning Platform for on-campus and self-directed online activity, with live and self-directed on-campus activities each week. 

### Laboratory Introduction

Laboratory sessions during the first three weeks of term will be used for a laboratory introduction exercise.
The laboratory introduction is COMPULSORY and must be passed before you can continue to work in the laboratory.
Components of the laboratory introduction are as follows:

* Health and safety and safe working in the electronics laboratory
* Breadboard construction exercise
* Circuit simulation exercise using National Instruments Multisim
* Soldering exercise

### On-demand learning activities

There will be one lecture a week on the architecture of the target microcontroller which will be delivered on-campus.

Knowledge and understanding will be increased via retrieval practice based on weekly formative tests delivered in Canvas.

Live online activities: there will be one hour a week office hour for group activities in support of the lecture course and designed to address the areas of particular difficulty that have been identified by the formative tests.

### Laboratory induction

The maximum mark for laboratory introduction is 15 awarded as follows:

* Testing of circuit using plug-in breadboard and National Multisim and answers to questions at the end of the laboratory introduction script – Max 10 marks - Assessed by Lab Diary and a Canvas quiz.
* Construction of Tic-Tac box continuity tester – Max 5 marks.

Marking is done and feedback is given by the module coordinator and the chief Electronics technician.

#### On-campus laboratories

There will be two two-hour lab sessions per week.

The lab exercises have been designed to be taken home and can be done partially off-campus if necessary.

The laboratory work will be assessed by means of a lab diary worth 20%
of the module marks. The lab diary is to be submitted via Canvas in November.

### Class test

The lecture course and the laboratory work will be assessed by an online class test worth 35%.

### Mini-project

There will be a mini-project which will be assessed by a demonstration of the completed project and a short report. The project is designed to be carried out using the resources of the laboratory kit, however additional components e.g. LEDs, resistors, push buttons and so on can be requested from the staff. A program will be provided as a starting point, and you will be required to add additional features as suggested in the project briefing.

## Timeline for EG-151

**Weeks 2-4**: Laboratory introduction. Students enrolling on the Electrical and Electronic degree programs come from a wide range of backgrounds. Some students will have taken a technology-based course in their previous education, and in consequence, they will have some familiarity with electronic components and embedded microcontrollers. Other students will have little or no experience with practical electronics. The laboratory introduction gives everybody an experience of using electronic components in a practical circuit, the use of laboratory instruments, and an introduction to simulation software. The laboratory introduction starts in week 2 and will continue for the first two weeks of teaching. It will make use of the on-campus timetabled lab slots. Assessment of the laboratory introduction is partly “on the spot” in the case of the Tic-Tac construction. The lab diary will be assessed at the end of the exercise and some questions answered by means of a Canvas quiz. The laboratory introduction is worth 15% of the module.

**Weeks 2 to 12**: On-demand materials and live timetabled online sessions. **There is one lecture per week, starting at 1 pm on Friday afternoons. This lecture includes the architecture of a typical 8-bit microcontroller, and how the internal registers permit different programming structures. Initially, examples will be in the C-language, but examples in assembly language, needed to understand the detailed working of the microcontroller hardware, will be given as the module progresses. Review and preparation for the class test will be given in Week 10; feedback on the class test will be given in Week 12.

**Weeks 3 to 8**: Following the laboratory introduction, you will embark on a series of experiments designed to build experience in programming the target microcontroller, and the use of an Integrated Development Environment to debug their programs. Detailed records of progress will be recorded in a lab diary which will be assessed at the end of the module. There will be an opportunity for feedback to be given on a lab diary record of a programming exercise before the complete lab diary is submitted for final assessment. Additional support will be available from the module lecturers, technicians and demonstrators during the lab sessions. This part of the module is worth 20% of the total.

**Week 9**: Briefing about the Mini Project.

**Weeks 9 to 12**: The mini-project carries 30% of the marks for this module.

All mini-projects will be based on the same core components. This approach has been very successful in Micromouse, where the starting point is the same for all the teams. This year, you will be provided with a project briefing, which will take the form of a suggested breadboard layout and an example program, so that a working system can be constructed. This year, each mini-project team will be given a plug-in breadboard, an Arduino microcontroller and an LCD alphanumeric display, capable of two lines of 16 characters. A suggested layout will be provided, showing how to connect the microcontroller to the LCD using the minimum number of pins. A demonstration program will also be provided to show how the LCD can be updated with ASCII characters.

Each mini-project team must decide on an application for these core components, for example, a digital multimeter, a frequency meter, an ultrasonic rangefinder, and so on. In each case, additional hardware and firmware must be connected to the core components to achieve the chosen application.

Starting from the demonstration program, it is possible to write a program that converts numeric data into ASCII characters. The data could come from the built-in ADC, or from some form of sensor such as an ultrasonic rangefinder. Each team will decide on the method of converting and presenting the information on the LCD.

The marking schedule for the mini-project may be found earlier in this document.

**Week 11**: The **class test** carries 35% of the module mark. It will be based on the taught material from the lecture course and experience from the laboratory exercises. Many of the questions will be of the form, “what bits will be set on Port X if the following lines of code are executed” and will require a detailed understanding of the operation of the microcontroller. The class test will be delivered electronically via a Canvas Quiz and feedback will therefore be immediate aside from any text or essay questions that will have to be manually marked.

**Week 12**: Assessment of mini-project. As mentioned above, the mini-project will be assessed on the basis of a successful demonstration of the completed project and a short report. The report should contain a reflection on what has been achieved in the mini-project, a well-commented program listing, and photographs of the completed project. Other evidence may be provided at your discretion.

## Specific rules for passing this module:

This module is assessed by a combination of a class test and practical assessment. In order for the practical assessment marks to count, you must achieve at least 30% in the class test. You will have one attempt to redeem a failure in the class test before the end of semester 1. If you achieve less than 30% in the class test, then the module mark will be just the class test mark and you will be required to take another test in August.
