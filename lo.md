[Canvas page - [Learning Outcomes and Transferable Skills](https://canvas.swansea.ac.uk/courses/52902/pages/learning-outcomes-and-transferable-skills?module_item_id=1797383)]

### Intended Learning Outcomes

#### Technical Outcomes

* Identify, classify, and describe the performance of systems and components (C6): operation of a microcontroller; computer instructions and their execution are assessed by Class Test.
* Practical and laboratory skills (C12): safe-working; use of electronic instrumentation; simulation, implementation, and commissioning of an embedded system are assessed by Lab Introduction (Practical).
* Investigate and define the problem: health and safety (C9); design simple programs in both assembly language and C; design the hardware and software for a simple application (C5). (Assessed by the Lab Introduction (Practical), Lab Exercises and Project)
* Ability to apply computational methods to solve engineering problems (C3): implement and commission an embedded system; demonstrate the application of the skills developed in the module to design the hardware and software for a simple application is assessed by the Project.
* Record results of work in a lab diary with reflections as a record of CPD (C18). Write a project report (C17).

#### Accreditation Outcomes

The following AHEP 4 Programme Learning outcomes [1] at Partial CEng (p) are partially addressed at a threshold level by this module: 

* C3 - Select and apply appropriate computational and analytical techniques to model and code well-defined programming problems
* C5 - Design solutions for well-defined problems.
* C6 - Apply an integrated or systems approach to the solution of embedded computing problems.
* C9 - Use a risk management process to identify, evaluate and mitigate risks associated with lab and project work.
* C12 - Use practical laboratory and workshop skills to investigate well defined problems.
* C17 - Communicate effectively on complex engineering matters via a lab diary and project report.
* C18 - Record personal development via reflections in a lab diary.

#### Transferable skills

1. Use of electronic instrumentation
